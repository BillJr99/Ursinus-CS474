title: "CS474: Human Computer Interaction - Final Project"


info:
  coursenum: CS474
  points: 100
  goals:
    - To demonstrate the fundamental concepts of human-computer interaction in a unified project
    - To work effectively as a member of a small group using collaborative tools for software development
  contract:
    a: 
    - "Each item required for a grade of B is included"
    - "The group consists of at least 2 and no more than 3 members"
    - "The project submitted was substantially consistent with the project proposed to and approved by the Professor"     
    b:
    - "Each item required for a grade of C is included"
    - "A substantial design report is included in the submission which documents the affordances and signifiers, modalities, design testing and feedback obtained during the project"
    c:
    - "Each item required for a grade of D is included"
    - "Each member of the group has a speaking role during the presentation"
    - "The project implementation is substantially correct and of reasonable human-centric design"
    - "A substantial design plan is included in the submission which documents the requirements, UI/UX workflow, affordances and signifiers, modalities, design testing, based on stakeholder input obtained and documented for the report"    
    d:
    - "Each member of the group makes meaningful contributions to the implementation of the project, demonstrated through version control commits or comments in the code"

In this project, you will propose a topic of your choosing and a group of at least 2 and up to 3 total members.  The project must be approved by the instructor before it may commence, but the topic is entirely up to you.  Multidisciplinary projects with a broader impact are encouraged, and you are welcome to collaborate with a stakeholder outside the department for inspiration on potential projects (this person is not to contribute code, only disciplinary context).  Regardless, your design should be carefully considered prior to the implementation, and should be regarded as at least as meaningful as the implementation itself.  Specifically, you should engage with a variety of diverse external stakeholders, and thoroughly document their engagement in the design process.

You should use git or another version control system to coordinate between your team.  **Each student shall contribute by checking in meaningful contributions to the project on the version control system.**

Finally, prepare as a team a project presentation that you will present live to the class for final presentations.  **Each student must have a speaking role** at the presentation.

In addition to your implementation, be sure to include a LaTeX design report in academic journal format (you can use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) for this purpose) that describes your initial design, rationale, stakeholder evaluation, and any subsequent revisions you made from your stakeholder input.

## Group Formation and Proposal (10 Points)

To form a group, students should draft a text document including the names of all students in the group, a summary of the proposed project, and a breakdown of each student's responsibilities on the team.  **Each student** should send this identical document to me for approval via e-mail.  I will respond via e-mail to the **entire** group notifying them that the project has been approved, and which members are on the team.  If I add or remove members from the team, I will notify the entire group via e-mail.  This shall constitute agreement of the project responsibilities by all members of the team.

Students who do not submit the proposal document described above (even if they are named in another group's proposal) within 3 days of the project hand-out date will be assigned to a group and notified via e-mail.  Students will not receive credit for the proposal in this situation.

Should a member of the team fail to participate to the standards set in the proposal document described above, one or more members of the group shall notify that student via e-mail of specific tasks from the proposal document that have been agreed to, along with a deadline to communicate with the group (copy me on the e-mail message).  If the student does not respond within 2 days of that message, the group should notify me via e-mail, and I will investigate and, if appropriate, I may re-organize the team by moving one or more members to other groups (whom I will notify via e-mail), or by removing the student from the group (whom I will notify via e-mail).  

## Design Plan (25 Points)

Before you begin, create a design plan in LaTeX that documents the requirements, UI/UX workflow, affordances and signifiers, modalities, design testing, based on stakeholder input obtained and documented for the report.

## Version Control 

See [this video](../Modules/Github/Module) for more information on using Git as a version control system to synchronize your project with your partners.
