On the discussion threads, write a brief reflection on each reading assigned in the course.  If you are the first to post a reflection, give the thread a title that matches the title of the reading article.  You should also continue the discussion by responding in a thoughtful and respectful way to posts that others have made.  Raise points of agreement and feel free to present differing perspectives: remember that it is the diversity of stakeholder inputs that enables a comprehensive human experience.

You may include any private reflections in your notebook.
