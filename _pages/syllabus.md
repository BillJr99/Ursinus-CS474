  course_description: "The study of human-computer interaction enables system architects to design useful, efficient, and enjoyable computer interfaces. This course teaches the theory, design procedure, and programming practices behind effective human interaction with computers. This course satisfies the College requirement for a capstone experience in the major. Offered in the spring semester of even years. Three hours per week."
  welcome_message: "Welcome to CS474!  In this course we will examine the scientific methods by which effective interfaces between humans and technology are designed.  We will explore the ways in which human psychology and physiology are leveraged to facilitate seamless human experiences, and how these are sometimes exploited to coerce engagement.  We will study how deficiencies in interface design are identified, and how remedies are determined.  We will apply these principles through the iterative design and development of a stakeholder-based system."

  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 10:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  Assignments will be accepted without prior permission following this time with a points deduction of 4% per day if submitted before 10:59 PM Eastern Time on the day submitted.  Each student will receive a total of 10 &quot;slack days&quot; for the semester with which to waive these grade reductions; for example, one assignment may be submitted 10 days late, or two assignments may be submitted 5 days late, with no grade reduction.  Sould an exemption to this policy be requested and granted, a 5% per day reduction will be applied.  This policy does not apply to extra credit opportunities: extra credit will not be awarded for assignments submitted under the flexible submission policy.  Late work cannot be accepted after the final class meeting, nor during final exams week, nor after the exam.  Students with accommodations will receive additional &quot;slack days&quot; as specified within the accommodations letter."

  miscpolicies:
    - title: "Attendance Policy"
      body: "It is anticipated that all classes in Spring 2022 will take place in-person. Remote teaching will only be allowed in extenuating and short-term circumstances. Students who are unable to attend class due to quarantine, isolation, or Covid-like symptoms in advance of test results should contact their instructors to make up work they have missed. Ursinus students are expected to attend class regularly and may receive penalties, including failing grades, for excessive non-health related absences. The Office of Academic Affairs, the Office of Student Affairs, and the Wellness Center do not provide excused absences from class.  Students experiencing significant health problems or other issues that may prevent them from performing adequately in their academic work and/or attending class for a number of days should notify the Institute for Student Success (Stephanie Stefanik, sstefanik@ursinus.edu; 610-409-3472), which can assist students with faculty notifications. Students who wish to discuss reasonable accommodations can contact Dr. Dee Singley (dsingley@ursinus.edu)."
    - title: "Masking Guidelines"
      body: "Students are expected to follow any college policy requiring mask wearing on campus, in addition to following any guidance faculty provide for their individual classes. Masks should be available in every academic building, if needed."
