excerpt: "CS474: Human Computer Interaction - Modalities - Eye Tracking"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To identify alternative modalities for human-computer interaction
    - To write a program that uses eye tracking for engagement
    - To identify signifiers and affordances for a given application and modality

      title: Eye Tracking
      questions:
        - "What kinds of applications can you think of that would benefit from eye tracking?"
        - "How might eye tracking enhance the user experience in applications that might not traditionally incorporate it?  In particular, how might eye tracking applications assist disabled persons using software?"
