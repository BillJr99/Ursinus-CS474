      title: "Robot Rights"
      questions:
        - "Why do robots need rights to protect them?"
        - "What should be the consequences of interfering with a robot performing a critical task?"
        - "How do otherwise beneficial devices degrade our autonomy or dignity, and to what extent should this be balanced with our desire to live independently?"
