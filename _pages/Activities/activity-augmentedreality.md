      questions:
        - "What sensors might you detect to display information about your surroundings, such as available wifi signals, or the location of a particular building on campus?"
        - "How might you modify this to use a different detector marker?"
        - "How might you modify this to display a dynamic image?"
        - "What are some ways in which people's actions are influenced by the deliberate manipulation of information visualizations from your own experience?"
