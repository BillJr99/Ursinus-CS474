excerpt: "CS474: Human Computer Interaction - The Way We Interact - Affordances and Signifiers"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To differentiate signifiers and affordances
    - To identify signifiers in everyday life
    - To identify potential shortcomings in both signifiers and affordances in technology

      title: "Affordances and Signifiers"
      questions:
        - "What are examples of visual signifiers in the physical world?"
        - "What are some intuitive or universal signifiers in technology?"
        - "Are some affordances made clear without signifiers?  What and how?  For example, how might a Norman Door be remedied without requiring signed instructions?"
        - "Consider a walk/don't walk sign at a crosswalk.  What non-visual signifiers would better indicate instructions to visually impaired persons?"
        - "What are some examples of affordances that exist for some people but not for others?  How can these be improved?"
        - "In the original Super Mario Bros., how does World 1-1 serve as a tutorial for new players without requiring textual instructions?"
