      questions:
        - "Why do you think incorrect memories like these persist?"
        - "Why are inaccuracies in collective memory sometimes of little consequence?"
        - "Try the <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/a-short-term-memory-experiment-2795664\">Memory Experiment</a> on this page.  How many words were you able to remember?"
        - "How might software systems leverage the limitations on average short term memory to provide a better user experience?"
        - "In Norman Figure 3.2, which control configuration is best and why?"
