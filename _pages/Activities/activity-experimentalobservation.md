      title: "Evaluating the User Experience"
      questions:
        - "Whose fault is it when a user fails to use a system properly?"
        - "A tree test presents the user with the workflow steps, one step at a time, and allows the user to progress in a choose-your-adventure style.  What kinds of deficiencies might this kind of study reveal?"
        - "An A/B test evaluates if one call to action is more effective than another.  How might you employ this in a software system to evaluate different user interface designs or workflows?"
        - "What would likely happen in these studies if all the stakeholders in a medical application UX study had the same job title?"
