excerpt: "CS474: Human Computer Interaction - Dark Patterns"

info: 
  goals: 
    - To identify examples of dark patterns in everyday life
    - To classify dark patterns into various common categories
    - To avoid infusing dark patterns into designs and implementations

      title: Facial Recognition Software
      questions:
        - "What are some examples in which we use facial recognition software today?"
        - "What's wrong with this picture?"
        - "The faces recognized in this screenshot were done using the <code>opencv</code> library.  Given what you know about eye tracking applications, how do you think faces are recognized by software?"
        - "What can you hypothesize about the manner in which this software was trained to recognize faces?"

      title: Dark Patterns
      questions:
        - "Have you ever encountered a website whose registration was broken into multiple steps, in which the first step asks only for non-personal information, but the last step requires contact or payment information?  Which dark pattern does this fall into?"
        - "For each of the types of dark patterns discussed, identify some real examples that exemplify each from your own personal experience."
        - "What kind of dark pattern(s) does the United States Postal Service (USPS) example fall into?  What incentive might the USPS have in requiring forms that cannot be accessed?  Is an account required to submit this form (and why or why not)?  What protocols might you put into place to enable accessible reporting of issues such as these?"
