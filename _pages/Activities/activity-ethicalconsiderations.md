      title: "Ethical Considerations and Diversity and Inclusivity"
      questions:
        - "What are the risks inherent in robotic policing or defense systems?"
        - "How do we balance dignity and privacy in applications such as aging-in-place with supportive care systems?"
        - "What is a &quot;Turing Deception&quot; with respect to &quot;Wizard-of-Oz&quot; robotics?"
        - "Why are people reluctant to raise issues of implicit bias or lack of autonomy in already-deployed systems?  When is the correct time to collect this kind of feedback, and how can the participating subjects be protected?"
        - "Two of these articles discuss a racial bias in health care applications and, in particular, a health care application that recommended less care to black patients.  How does this kind of bias wind up in software systems; why doesn't software reduce unconscious bias, given that it lacks consciousness?"
        - "What constraints would you introduce to validate a name input box to mitigate possible SQL injection attacks?  Why is this dangerous for inclusivity, and what can be done about it?"
