  goals: 
    - To define human factors in computing
    - To describe the evolution from system-based engagement with technology to a more seamless task-based approach

      title: Evolution of User Interfaces
      questions:
        - "Run two applications in Windows 1.0.  How might one copy data between two applications?"
        - "In what ways does this differ from the way you engage with multiple tasks today?  In what ways did this interface inform the modern Windows interface?"
        - "How have we evolved from a system-based approach to user interfaces to a task-based approach?"

      title: Human Factors
      questions:
        - "What do you consider to be the ideal smart phone size, and why?"
        - "Draw a graph with accuracy on one axis, and your reaction speed on the other.  If you were to plot these against one another for some task, for example, for clicking a button as soon as it appears on the screen, how might this plot look?"
        - "What other human factors might you account for when designing a software system?"
        - "How and when should you evaluate the speed-accuracy tradeoff and other physiological and psychological human factors?"
        - "How might human factors considerations change under different modalities; for example, looking at a button to click on it versus tapping it with a finger?"
        - "Give your partner a number of choices (for example, where to go for lunch) for two or three questions, and measure how long it takes them to make a decision.  Plot the time versus the number of choices.  What do you observe?  Did it follow the model given by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law\">Hick's Law</a>?"
